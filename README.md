# HydrogenBondAnalysis
Analyze hydrogen bonding network in from a molecular dynamics simulation trajectory, taking a simulation from a water solulble protein as an example.
This protein has a bilobed structure and the ligand binds to the cleft between the two lobes (lobe 1 & lobe 2).
The analysis aims to identify ALL the possible hydrogen bonding partners between lobe 1 and lobe 2. 
However, the hydrogen bonds that are mediated by water or ions are not considered.
The analysis mainly consists of three steps:
1. identify the interesting protein domains to
